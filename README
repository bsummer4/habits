This is a habit tracking webapp that I use as a self-improvement tool.

# Backend
TODO Copy data from the production server to use as a use-case.

# FrontEnd
TODO Hack together a simple client that uses the entire API.
  TODO Show all chains upto today for successful habits.
  TODO Show all chains upto yesterday for successful habits.
  TODO Associate a double with each habit.
  TODO Get plots for each habit.
  TODO Create a log-in page on the client, and store the token in local storage.

  TODO Rewrite the entire front-end in a way that doesn't suck.
  TODO Rework the protocol to use Web Sockets for real-time client updates.

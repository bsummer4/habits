This is a webapp that displays a random slideshow of a set of images and
captions. It currently doesn't do anything besides serve files.

TODO Maybe it would be better to let users specify their own urls for images?
	Yeah, sure, but let's get things working the dumb way first.
	That requires persistent data structures, logins, sessions, etc.
	The current approach requires nothing.

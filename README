This is a habit tracking webapp that I use as a self-improvement tool.

# Backend
TODO Copy data from the production server to use as a use-case.
TODO Write migrations
TODO Fill out the API to support all the features the datastore supports.
TODO Stop Treating unspecified HabitStatus as a break in the chain.
  Successful habits increase the chain length.
  Failed habits end the chain.
  Unspecified habits should simply be skipped over.

TODO Make ‘State.hs’ purely functional.
  We only need two acid-state events.
    A Query for Query requests
    An update for Update requests.

TODO Consider making notes markable with statuses.
TODO Consider separating the number associated with a habit from it's status.
  From a UI perspective, cycling the habit status should not delete
    the number data.

# FrontEnd
TODO Hack together a simple client that uses the entire API.
  TODO Show all chains upto today for successful habits.
  TODO Show all chains upto yesterday for successful habits.
  TODO Associate a double with each habit.
  TODO Get plots for each habit.
  TODO Create a log-in page on the client, and store the token in local storage.

TODO Release an Alpha version
  TODO Rewrite the entire front-end in a way that doesn't suck.
  TODO Rework the protocol to use Web Sockets for real-time client updates.
